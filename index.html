            <p><span class="span-title">What are internet personalities? </span>
              Well, if I am the one to define it, I have many definitions. THAT
              girl, Clean girl, Sigma, Female rage and different kind of
              aesthetics. We adapt our lifestyles from those internet
              personalities and aesthetics. That is not wrong. Of course they
              are inspirational and motivational. Taking inspiration and
              motivation from those is not wrong “technically” if we have a
              limit.
              How it is affecting us? (Bold)
              Our lives are different from each other and we cannot expect them
              to fit into one internet personality (or) an aesthetic. We see
              those aesthetic lifestyles on Tiktok trends such as “THAT girl”
              “how to get the old money look” and we start comparing our
              lifestyles to those little snippets we see on social media. When
              we see those little snippets on social media, we start to compare
              our lives to their lives. We start to doubt ourselves and feel
              like we are not enough because our lives are not “aesthetically
              pleasing” like theirs. The reason why we don't have confidence in
              ourselves is because we take too much inspiration from other
              people on social media. The longer it gets, we start to doubt
              ourselves. I want to call it “inspiration overload”. </p>

              <span class="span-title">The truth</span>
              The truth is “no one is perfect” and I know you are tired of
              hearing that but it is the truth. Not even those old money people
              you admire. Those little snippets you see on social media are just
              “snippets”. We capture the happy moments and we post them on
              social media and that is also how other people do. Just showing
              the highlight of their morning routines doesn't mean their lives
              are aesthetically pleasing and perfect. No one show their lows and
              post their rock bottom times as aesthetic on social media.

                What we need to do
              </span>
              Gratitude. Being grateful for what we have. A person from “my
              comfort bubble” once told me about what he does when he sees
              someone who he “thinks better than him”. He said “I just remember
              the people who accept me for who I am and that way, I feel
              grateful for being me and not being that random person from
              internet. I feel grateful for what I have, I feel grateful for
              people who chose a stone while there's a diamond on other path.”
              We should be grateful for we have other than focusing on other
              people lives and what they post as highlights on social media. We
              have a roof over our heads and a floor under us. We have a bed to
              sleep in and a house to live. We tend to forget to take
              inspiration from ourselves sometimes because we just focus on
              outwards but not inwards. Today I would like to send you a message
              to remind you that you should take inspiration from yourself and
              not just from others. Remember gratitude is the key.
